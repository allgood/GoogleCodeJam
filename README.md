Allgood's submissions to Google Code Jam
========================================

This GitHub repository will be used to put all my submissions
to Google Code Jam. Of course that all problem solution code will are published
after the end of the round.

The first intent of this repository is for myself, to help me keep track of my participations. My code isn't probably the best, since my rank is not so good.

The first commit of code for each round will be the exact code I've submitted to the contest, with any errors that I have made into the large answers.

Google Code Jam 2016
--------------------

### Qualification Round

The Qualification Round happened from Apr, 8 2016 23:00UTC to Apr, 10 2016 01:00 UTC.

The first code for the problem D, available on changeset f278392, large solution is wrong as I've failed on it. Finished the round with 75 points in the 3714th place out of almost 30k competitors.

After this I've corrected the solution based on the [official analysis of the problem](https://code.google.com/codejam/contest/6254486/dashboard#s=a&a=3) and it is available on the git head.

### Round 1-A

Solved only the first problem on the given time. Problem was very simple.

Allgood's submissions to Google Code Jam
========================================

This GitHub repository will be used to put all my submissions
to Google Code Jam. Of course that all problem solution code will are published
after the end of the round.

The first intent of this repository is for myself, to help me keep track of my participations. My code isn't probably the best, since my rank is not so good.

The first commit of code for each round will be the exact code I've submitted to the contest, with any errors that I have made into the large answers.
